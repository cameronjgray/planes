# Planes

This is a fun script which will output all the departing planes from a given airport. It uses data from [Aviation Stack](https://aviationstack.com/). Flights may be listed twice in the list if it is being used by multiple airlines.

### Usage
```sh 
$ ./planes.sh -a ICAO
```

Note: You will need to add a file called `access_key` to the directory with your access key for Aviation Stack
